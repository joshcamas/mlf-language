# mlf-language
Atom language package for the Multi Language Format

(MLF repo coming soon)

### About MLF
MLF is currently utilized in-house by Spellcast Studios in Unity3D for a variety of uses, such as scripting, quests and dialog. Since the key feature of MLF is simply to be a human readable wrapper for other languages, it allows different formats to be in the same file, with different tags and id's for the engine to read.

### Releasing MLF
Sadly a major caveat of MLF is its dependancy on a addon named Odin Inspector. However I still wish to open source MLF, mainly as a way to show how text based formats are so useful. :)

### About MLF
MLF is currently utilized in-house by Spellcast Studios for a variety of uses, such as scripting, quests and dialog. Since the key feature of MLF is simply to be a human readable wrapper for other languages, it allows different formats to be in the same file, with different tags and id's for the engine to read.
